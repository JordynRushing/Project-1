  <p>Carrots: Originally, carrots were purple. The purple color comes from anthocyanin pigments. The orange carrots that are common today were introduced in the Netherlands in the 17th century.
    Tomatoes: Botanically, tomatoes are fruits because they grow from flowers and contain seeds. However, they are commonly used as vegetables in cooking.
    Baby carrots: Baby carrots are just regular carrots that have been cut down to a smaller size. This practice started as a way to use carrots that were misshapen or had blemishes.
